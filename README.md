# k6 Workshop

This is a work in progress!

## Objectives

The main goal of this workshop is to give attendees enough hands-on experience to be able to build and execute their own performance tests as part of their current testing efforts.

Upon completing the workshop, attendees will know how to write realistic load tests that mimic real-life user behavior, how to identify what to focus their testing efforts on, how to automate their tests as well as how to visualize and interpret the results.
