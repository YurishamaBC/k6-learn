As a first step, we'll do a basic HTTP POST request against a test API that will echo back whatever we're sending to it.

Create a new file named `test.js`, and open it in your favorite IDE:

```bash
$ touch ./test.js
```

We'll now start by importing the HTTP Client from the built-in module `k6/http`.

```js
import http from 'k6/http';
```

We'll then create and export a default function, which is what will be executed by our virtual user:

```js
export default function() {
}
```

Next, we'll add the logic for making the actual http call.

```js
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function() {
  let url = 'https://httpbin.test.k6.io/';
  http.post(url, 'hello, world!');
}
```

While this will work, it's not particularly useful. We have no idea whether the request actually returns anything, and if it does; whether it is what we expected. Let's log the response to the console, just to make sure:

```js
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function() {
  let url = 'https://httpbin.test.k6.io/';
  let r = http.post(url, 'hello, world!');
  
  console.log(r.json().data);
}
```

As a last step, let's go ahead and actually run our test:

```plain
$ k6 run test.js

          /\      |â€¾â€¾| /â€¾â€¾/   /â€¾â€¾/
     /\  /  \     |  |/  /   /  /
    /  \/    \    |     (   /   â€¾â€¾\
   /          \   |  |\  \ |  (â€¾)  |
  / __________ \  |__| \__\ \_____/ .io

  execution: local
     script: 01-hello-world.js
     output: -

Did you spot that? The logging we added is actually part of the output! 

```plain
INFO[0001] hello, world!                                 source=console
```

> ### ðŸ§   Did you know?
> The k6 HTTP client has built-in support for all of the HTTP methods commonly used to interact with a web server. In this example we did a `POST` request using `http.post`, but the following methods are available as well:
> 
> - `DELETE`, or `http.del`
> - `GET`, or `http.get`
> - `OPTIONS`, or `http.options`
> - `PATCH`, or `http.patch`
> - `PUT`,or `http.put`
>
> ...or if you want to do something completely different, the even more customizable `http.request`.

As for the rest of the output, we'll have a look at that in the next part.
