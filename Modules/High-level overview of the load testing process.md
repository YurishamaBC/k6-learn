# High-level overview of the load testing process

In the last section, you learned about what load testing is, how it's different from performance testing, and what the different types of test scenarios are. In this section, you'll learn about the different phases of the load testing process:
- Planning for load testing
- Scripting a load test
- Executing load tests
- Analysis of load testing results
- Continuous load testing


## Planning for load testing

- Formulate requirements for load testing
- Clarify scope of testing
- Define entry and exit criteria
- Identify workload models
- Set up environment for testing, including Monitoring

## Scripting a load test

- Making scripts realistic
- Load tests as code
- Setting up a robust testing framework

## Executing load tests

- Baseline tests
- Increasing blast radius
- Cloud vs on-prem
- Distributed testing and scaling up

## Analysis of load testing results

- Collation and aggregation
- Remediation of bottlenecks

## Continuous load testing

- Incorporating load testing into CI/CD pipeline
