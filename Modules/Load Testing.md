### What is load testing?

The term "load testing" refers to a type of back-end performance testing that involves simulating a number of users accessing the application. However, back-end performance testing encompasses more than just load testing. Load testing is one technique that can be used to verify back-end performance.

k6 is primarily a back-end performance testing tool that specializes in load testing but can also be used to run other types of tests, such as chaos experiments or functional API tests.

 If an application is meant to be used by multiple users, single user manual testing is no longer a sufficient or accurate measure of what it will actually be like to use the application. Web applications, in particular, should be prepared to withstand some degree of viral popularity, or face the loss of potential customers or brand reputation.[[README]]
