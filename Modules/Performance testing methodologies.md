# Performance testing Methodologies
Software development methodologies. The software world has been changing a lot recently, not only in technological terms but also in how we create it. Both changes impact software's multiple areas, especially how we test it and assure its quality. As performance testing is a proud member of the QA realm, of course, it gets several impacts and changes to its ways.

On top of it, new technologies are changing how we do things. Some of those new techs are service tiered applications, micro-services spread all over the place, and even the cloud! All are changing how we do things.

But before we get deeper into those impacts on the performance ways, let's do a quick recap on what are these software development methodologies.




## Methodologies in general

Today, right after the pandemic days, we have two primary methodologies used in the software industry. Each of the two types has variations, but we can group them into two big flavors: Waterfall and Agile.

Waterfall seems to be on its way out. Most organizations are trying to transition away from Waterfall and embrace a variation of the new Agile methodologies. Some are taking steps, others are struggling, and very few are successfully implementing and reaping their success.

Here is a short description of each type.

  

### Waterfall methodologies

The waterfall methodologies have been present in the software development industry almost from its beginnings. A brief description would be a phased project. Each phase involved specific groups of specialized people, and generally, the final product was delivered several months and even years after it started.

  

An average waterfall project would start with a **discovery** phase defining problems and needs around making it happen. Then, a **design** phase would plan every second of the project's long life. The team would begin the **build-up** phase that constructed everything on the plan at hand. The **testing** phase would start once all the code was written and assembled. Finally, after the software (hopefully) passes all the tests, it is ready for **release**. Once finished, the implementing team would **wrap up** and set off to new pastures.

  

Some of the flaws in the waterfall methodologies are: 

Most of the time, the projections and estimations were wrong with so much time in advance. Issues impacted the schedule, but management rarely changed the release date or scope. Other sliding phases commonly ate the time allowed for testing. It was hard to go back to the development phase when testing found issues. As the release date came closer, the teams churned to deliver still on time. And many more.

  

### Agile methodologies

There are so many variations for these development styles. Among them, we can find Scrum, CI/CD, DevOps, Kanban, Shape-Up, SAFE, and the list goes on and on. 

But an essential characteristic for all these methodologies is splitting the deliverable into small pieces. Then, releasing those pieces as often as possible. Contrary to the Waterfall, which had a single big-bang release once or twice a year.

The goal is to get those pieces in front of the end-user as fast as possible, measure the reception and quality, and define the following steps based on that feedback.

  

**_Note_**: If you find a project that claims to be an Agile flavor but doesn't release to _production_ frequently nor pay close attention to those frequent releases' feedback, they may not be agile.

  
  

## Performance testing

In the same way, QA practices, and especially performance testing, are different depending on the methodology and technology that the application has.

Let's dive into how is the approach on each of those methodologies. But beware, there is a mix on the path. We have the two methodologies mentioned above, but our solutions also have ancient designs and modern technology. These are the monoliths and the contemporary service-tiered cloud apps.
